This repository contains my projects, research, and analyses related to Meteorology during my university studies and personal learning journey.

Each project is stored in its own folder, with explanations, code, and results.

## Tools Used:
- Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes:
Meteorology strengthens my skills in critical thinking and data analysis â€” skills I also apply in cybersecurity.
