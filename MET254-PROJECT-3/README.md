# MET 254 Project 3 : Spatial Plots of Precipitation Flux Data for Ghana

## Project Overview
This repository contains project for MET 254 (Python for Scientific Computing). The objective of the project is to create spatial plots showing the mean precipitation flux (in mm/day) for each month of a past year and a future year (2090) over Ghana, using precipitation flux data from a NetCDF dataset. The plots are overlaid on a map of Ghana, highlighting its ecological zones (Sudan Savannah, Guinea Savannah, Transition Zone, Forest, and Coast).

The project uses Python libraries such as `xarray`, `matplotlib`, `cartopy`, and `PIL` to process the data and generate the visualizations.


## Repository Contents
- `MET254PROJECT3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data processing and visualization.
- `journal.png`: Map of Ghana showing ecological zones and major cities, used as the base image for the spatial plots.
- `MET254_data.nc`: NetCDF dataset containing precipitation flux data (Note: a download link is provided below).
- `2090_Prep.png`: Output image showing the spatial plots of mean precipitation for each month in 2090.
- `2000_Prep.png`: Output image showing the spatial plots of mean precipitation for each month in 2000.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dataset
The dataset `MET254_data.nc` contains precipitation flux data (`rain`) from 1971 to 2100, with dimensions:
- Time: 47,482 time steps (daily data from 1971 to 2100).
- Latitude: 37 points (4.51째N to 12.43째N).
- Longitude: 23 points (-3.41째E to 1.43째E).
- Variable: `rain` (precipitation flux in mm/day).

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `xarray`
- `matplotlib`
- `cartopy`
- `Pillow` (PIL)
- `numpy` (usually installed with `xarray`)
  
Additionally, you may need to install netCDF4 for reading NetCDF files:
```bash
pip install netCDF4
```

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install xarray matplotlib cartopy Pillow numpy
```

```bash
conda install cartopy
```
